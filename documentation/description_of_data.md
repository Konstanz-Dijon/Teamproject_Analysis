## BOSCH
- DSP= Deckenstrahlplatte (heating on the ceiling): Heating elements installed on the ceiling of a room to release heat.
- ERRECHNETE_RAUMTEMPERATURE_DSP = set temperature for this heating: Target temperature for the DSP.
- RBG_RAUMTEMPERATUR = temperature of the room: The actual temperature in the room being measured.
- ANSTEUERUNG_DSP_VENTIL = valve control for DSP heating: A control signal for the valve that regulates the volume flow of the heat transfer fluid through the ceiling jet plates.
- DSP_FLOOR_DISTRIBUTOR_DURCHFLUSS = volume flow at floor distributor to DSP heating [m^3/h]: The volume flow of the heat transfer fluid at the floor distributor leading to the ceiling jet plates.
- DSP_FLOOR_DISTRIBUTOR_RUECKLAUFTEMPERATUR = temperature of outcoming volume flow [°C]: The temperature of the volume flowing out of the DSP.
- DSP_FLOOR_DISTRIBUTOR_VORLAUFTEMPERATUR = temperature of incoming volume flow [°C]: The temperature of the volume flowing into the DSP.
- DSP_FLOOR_DISTRIBUTOR_LEISTUNG_EQUIPMENT = power of heating [kW]:The power of the heating equipment connected to the floor distributor for the DSP. 
- HK_CIRCUIT = heating circuit (hot circuit): The heating circuit comprising the heating system.
- KK_CIRCUIT = cooling circuit (cold circuit): The cooling system circuit comprising the cooling system.
- VL = incoming volume flow: The volume flow of heat transfer fluid entering the heating or cooling appliance.
- RL = outcoming volume flow: The volume flow of heat transfer fluid coming out of the heating or cooling appliance.
