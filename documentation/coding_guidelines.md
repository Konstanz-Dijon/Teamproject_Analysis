# CODING Guidelines

Coding guidelines can help fasten up the development and helps keeping the quality of code at a high level.

## Python Naming Convention
### Variables
- A variable name must start with a letter or the underscore character (*variable* ||  *_variable*)
- A variable name cannot start with a number (~~1variable~~)
- A variable name can **only** contain **alpha-numeric** characters and **underscores** (A-z, 0-9, and _ )
- Variable names are **case-sensitive** (age != Age != AGE)
- A variable name cannot be any of the Python [keywords](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_ref_keywords.asp).

### Multi-World-Variables

Python allows camelCase, PascalCase and snake_case.
